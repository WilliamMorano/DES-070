        <p>
            I jolted awake suddenly, as melancholy thoughts filled my head. Today was the day. 
            The day of the final judgment. I prepared for today like any other day: showering, 
            eating breakfast, brushing my teeth... However, a constant feeling of dread hovered 
            over me, as I realized that the completion of each trivial morning chore was a step 
            closer to the event. Eventually, the list was completed and I headed on my way to school.

        <p>
            Friends, teachers, cafeteria staff, and even the friendly bus drivers possessed no remedy to 
            my saddened state. I simply could not shake the melancholy thoughts that arrived at the beginning 
            of the day from my brain. I began to ponder how one could justify this dreaded, future event. 
            Despite applying the majority of my brain power to this question, I could not come up with an answer, 
            for this question dealt with the great existential questions of humankind…

            What would life be like without suffering? <br>
            Is suffering a necessary part of human existence?  <br>
            Is happiness a right or a privilege? <br>
            What is more important: the ends or the means?<br>
            Is it immoral for a vegetarian to eat animal crackers?

    <div class="locker"></div>
    <div class="info" id="four">
        <p>
            My mind was kept busy with these questions. However, when the final bell before the event screeched, 
            my thoughts cleared. I made my way into the musty gym locker room and started to prepare for the event. 
            The tools I required included an extra change of clothes, an ample supply of water, knee braces, and a 
            headband. My peers likewise prepared for the event: last minute deodorant applications, quad stretches, 
            double bunny ears knots. The clock struck 2:00, so we exited the locker room to begin the event

    <div class="info" id="five">
        <p>
            The sun filtered through the vast windows, bringing in scorching heat. The gymnasium was silent. Anticipation, 
            anxiety, and adrenaline filled the room. This was it. The time was now. We made our way to the line. On arrival, 
            the gym speakers blared a cruel noise: <br><br> The FitnessGram™ Pacer Test is a multistage aerobic capacity test that 
            progressively gets more difficult as it continues.
