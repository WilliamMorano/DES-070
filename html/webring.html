            I jolted awake suddenly, as melancholy thoughts filled my head. Today was the day. 
            The day of the final judgment. I prepared for today like any other day: showering, 
            eating breakfast, brushing my teeth... However, a constant feeling of dread hovered 
            over me, as I realized that the completion of each trivial morning chore was a step 
            closer to the event. Eventually, the list was completed and I headed on my way to school.

            Friends, teachers, cafeteria staff, and even the friendly bus drivers possessed no remedy to 
            my saddened state. I simply could not shake the melancholy thoughts that arrived at the beginning 
            of the day from my brain. I began to ponder how one could justify this dreaded, future event. 
            Despite applying the majority of my brain power to this question, I could not come up with an answer, 
            for this question dealt with the great existential questions of humankind…

            What would life be like without suffering? 
            Is suffering a necessary part of human existence?  
            Is happiness a right or a privilege? 
            What is more important: the ends or the means?
            Is it immoral for a vegetarian to eat animal crackers?

        <p>
            My mind was kept busy with these questions. However, when the final bell before the event screeched, 
            my thoughts cleared. I made my way into the musty gym locker room and started to prepare for the event. 
            The tools I required included an extra change of clothes, an ample supply of water, knee braces, and a 
            headband. My peers likewise prepared for the event: last minute deodorant applications, quad stretches, 
            double bunny ears knots. The clock struck 2:00, so we exited the locker room to begin the event

            The FitnessGram™ Pacer Test is a multistage aerobic capacity test that progressively gets more difficult as it 
            continues. The 20 meter pacer test will begin in 30 seconds. Line up at the start. The running speed starts 
            slowly, but gets faster each minute after you hear this signal. [beep] A single lap should be completed each 
            time you hear this sound. [ding] Remember to run in a straight line, and run as long as possible. The second 
            time you fail to complete a lap before the sound, your test is over. The test will begin on the word start. 
            <br><br>On your mark, get ready… start.
